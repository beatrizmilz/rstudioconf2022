## Planejamento da palestra

Título da palestra: Making awesome automations with Github Actions

Tempo: 4 min 45 s.

- Quem é meu público alvo?

As pessoas que vão participar da RStudio Conf são pessoas que, no geral, já tem contato com a linguagem de programação R. Porém, com níveis de experiências diferentes. Parte das pessoas são as pessoas especialistas, que já criam e mantém pacotes, etc. Outra parte são pessoas que utilizam R em seus trabalhos e estão lá para aprender mais sobre as  aplicações possíveis. Esse é o grupo que eu pretendo atingir mais.




Ideia de roteiro:

- slide de abertura: Hi everyone! It's a great honor to be here to present this talk. Today I'm going to talk about how to make awesome automations with GitHub Actions.

- Slide de apresentação sobre mim: First, a little bit about myself: my name is Beatriz, I am an R-Lady from Brazil, and I really really like to automate repetitive tasks.

- Today my aim is to answer this question: "What is GitHub Actions? How can I run R Scripts with it?"

- So, i'm going to ask a question and would be really nice if you could raise your hand if this applies to you:  do you have to do a task using R in a regular basis? like every day, once a week, once a month, for example?

(WAIT SOME SECONDS SO PEOPLE CAN THINK AND RAISE THEIR HANDS)

- If you raised your hand, GitHub Actions can be usefull to you. 


- So... Imagine that you have to go to the post office to deliver a mail everyday. Everyday you get to walk in the same path, deliver it and then go back to your house. Everyday! That feels exausthing, right?

- BUT! If you found out about an awesome robot that could take your mail at your house and deliver it at the post office everyday, so you don't need to do it yourself? That would be awesome, right?

- GitHub Actions can be like this awesome robot!


- GitHub Actions has been heavily used in some contexts, like runing checks in packages. The tidyverse packages all use it. But what about people that are not package developers? What can we do apart from that? 


- This are some of the things that I do with Actions:

  - I Scrape data from the internet...

  - ...and save it on the repository, in a database, or on a Google sheet..
  
  - Send emails for me

  - Run a regular R Script and save the results
  
  - So a lot of awesome tasks.
  

- How you can start doing that?

- First, you need a GitHub Account! You can sign up for free at github.com and there you go.

- Then, you need a repository! If you don't know what a repository is, imagine that you have a folder with all the files that you need in a project and you uploaded it somewhere, like in Google Drive. The repository is like that, it stores the files of your project, but is way easier to work with other people that are also programming.
